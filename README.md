# Machine Learning & Optimization

1. Robust Regressions - an Mixed Integer Optimizaton (MIO) formulation of regression with a L1/L2 regularization term to achieve robustness

2. Holistic Regressions - an MIO formulation to select the best linear model with sparsity, robustness and low pair-wise multi-colinearity

3. Convex Regressions - an MIO formulation solved using cutting plane

4. Prescriptive Analytics - integrating the predictive outputs of a random forest model into an optimization model to solve the multi-item Newsvendor Problem
